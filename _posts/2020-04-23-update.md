## April 23, 2020

### PM Trudeau

* $1.1B for a medical research strategy to address COVID-19 - to develop vaccines, produce treatments, & track the virus
* $115M for research into vaccines and treatments being developed in Canada's medical labs and universities
* $662M for domestic clinical trials so we can scale up vaccines and treatments as soon as they're ready
* $350M to expand national testing and modelling of COVID-19, also creating an "Immunity Task Force" to conduct blood tests
* 20,000 daily tests (2x from earlier this month) - target is 60,000 tests per day before the country begins to reopen the economy

### Ontario Premier Ford

* Federal government has agreed to the provincial request for support from the Canadian Forces in long-term care homes
* $148M in direct funding to social services relief fund to support our most vulnerable
* $40M for a residential relief fund for homeless shelters and group homes dealing with COVID-19 outbreaks
* The Premier was visibly shaken when discussing the issue in long-term care homes - "the system needs to be better"
* In the next day or two they will roll out what restrictions will be eased (was asked about gardening centres)

### Qu√©bec Premier Legault

* The health-care network saw a drop of 800 personnel just yesterday and is missing a total of 9,500 as more get infected, are awaiting results or self-isolating to protect their families. The Premier urged those who can to return to work "We need you"
* Two distinct realities; Long-term health care homes and the rest of society. The premier made it clear that overall the province was doing well overall but the situation in long-term health care homes is dire
* The plan to re-open schools and businesses set to be made public next week will take the form of calenda that will be managed by Dr. Arruda and his team
